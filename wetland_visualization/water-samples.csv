Water is flowing west. Sample taken from center of stream. Both filtered and unfiltered water samples taken. o sediment samples taken because this location on Aurand run is bedrock. The water measurements for this sample can also be used for 63. Tons of vegetation around this access point. We sample directly under the highway. Flow is coming from Aurand run itself, the tile connection at this point looks dry. Velocity of water flow is 0.29 m/s at depth of 0.12 m. At 0.17 m it is the same and at 0.07 m, so it is independent of depth. ",,41.023889,-83.698333
