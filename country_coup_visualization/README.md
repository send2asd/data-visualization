# Visualization Design
## Overview
- The project aims to create a visualization for unstructured data, specifically stories about approximately 12 countries in South America. The goal is to make the data more accessible and interesting for users who want to explore historical events in these countries.

### User's Perspectives
- Data Presentation:

- "I would like to see the data in visual format. Reading texts within a document file are not efficient and not as interesting."
Temporal Exploration:

- "Is it possible to see visualizations that can effectively show events happening over different time periods/years? Maybe, I would like to control what kind of information can be shown during/at certain time periods. Can it also show relationships, if any?"
Geographical Information:

- "Maybe having information displayed on a map might also be useful."

### Keyword Search:

- "Can there be a filtering functionality based on keyword search?"

### Multimedia Integration:

- "Would it be possible to include 1-2 pictures for some of the historical events?"

### Visualization Design Requirements

#### Four-level, Nested Design:

- Detailed design at each level, considering the user's perspective.
- Multiple Visualization Idioms/Methods:

- At least two different visualization methods that are justified based on their suitability for the data.
Interactivity:

- At least three different interactivities, such as zoom in/out, mouse clicking/dragging, and changes based on user interaction.
Appealing Design:

- A visually appealing design, including a good layout, pleasant color combination, and thoughtful interactions.
